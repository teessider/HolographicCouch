# The Holographic Couch
Project Files for _It's A Kind of Magic: Shaders!_ talk from **Games Couch Conference 2019**

This was made in **Unreal Engine 4.21**.

In theory though, the materials made here can be applied to any version of the engine (As long as they have input for World Position and Masked Opacity :wink: ).
